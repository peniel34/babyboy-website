<p align="center"><b><font size="5">UNCLEAN SUPPLY OF WATER</font></b>
<p>&nbsp To begin, contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, etc.
   Unclean water refers to water that is contaminated or polluted by various substances, microorganisms, chemicals, or other impurities that pose a risk to human health or the environment. This contamination can occur through various sources, such as industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, improper disposal of waste, sewage leakage, and natural processes. Some common contaminants found in unclean water:
1.	Biological Contaminants
2.	Chemical contaminants
3.	Sediments
4.	Organic contaminants
5.	Micro plastics
6.	Nutrient pollution
According to my survey around my community, I got to know that an unclean supply of water can lead to certain issues that are harmful to the health of the in-taker of such liquid. 
It is known to everyone that water is one of the essentials of life, it is one of the basic elements which is very crucial to our everyday life. We make use of water every single day and some of which are:
1.	Bathing 
2.	For drinking
3.	For washing
4.	Cooking, etc.
 
<p>Additionally, I figured out about some causes of an unclean source of water which I will like to discuss. Some of which are:
<p>&nbsp 1.	Bacterial contamination: Water sources can become contaminated with bacteria from sewage, animal waste (e.g., cow dung), or human activities. Bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter can cause illness like diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps.
<p>&nbsp 2.	Viral contamination: Viruses like nor virus and hepatitis A can also contaminate water sources, leading to gastrointestinal illnesses and other health problems.
<p>&nbsp 3.	Parasitic contamination: parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium can be present in unclean water sources, causing severe gastrointestinal issue and other health complications.
<p>&nbsp 4.	Chemical pollution: Industrial activities, agricultural runoff, and improper disposal of chemicals can introduce harmful substances like heavy metals, pesticides, and solvents into the water supply.

 
<p>Furthermore, I have expatiated on the causes and harmful effect of a community with an unclean supply of water. Therefore a solution has to be found so as to eradicate the harmful effects of the unclean water. Many solutions can be provided to this problem which some of which are:
<p>&nbsp 1.	Coagulation (Addition of alum or ferric chloride): The addition of the mentioned chemicals to water neutralizes charges on particles, allowing them to clump together (flocculate) and settle out.

<p>&nbsp 2.	Sedimentation: After coagulation, water is allowed to sit in a basin or any container to allow larger particles to settle at the bottom.

<p>&nbsp 3.	Filtration: Water passes through layers of sand, gravel, and charcoal to remove remaining particles to remove remaining particles, sediment, and impurities.

<p>&nbsp 4.	Disinfection: Water is treated with disinfectants like chlorine, ozone, or UV light to kill or deactivate harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

<p>&nbsp 5.	Desalination: Technologies like reverse osmosis or distillation are used to remove dissolved salts and minerals from seawater or brackish water to make it potable.

<p>&nbsp 6.	Adsorption: Activated carbon filters are often used to adsorb organic compounds, chlorine, pesticides, and other impurities from water.

<p>&nbsp 7.	Electrocoagulation: This technology uses an electric  current to destabilize suspended pollutants and facilitate their removal through coagulation
 
<p>Finally, if this problem is seen form another perspective, which is turning this problem into a source of income. I personally will pick out of all the solutions to it and pick a suitable one. 
	I will make use of the coagulation process, which is the addition of the chemical alum. To be able to achieve this I will do the following:
<p>&nbsp 1.	I will make a survey around the community if there is anyone into the sales of alum or if there are few.
<p>&nbsp 2.	Then, I will build up a little capital to start the purchase of the chemical(Alum) from the actual market place.
<p>&nbsp 3.	Most importantly I will take my markets to people telling them how important it is to have an healthy source of water and explain the use of the Chemical (Alum) as a form of advertisement to increase the amount of customers.
<p>&nbsp 4.	Looking at the area I will place the price of the Chemical(Alum) according to what they can afford.
<p>&nbsp 5.	Within a period of time, getting into the production of the chemical(Alum) will be very helpful to increase my production.
<p>To wrap it up I think the Alum in places it is been demanded is an example of a business opportunity I will invest myself in.<hr>
